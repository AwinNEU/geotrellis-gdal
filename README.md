GDAL supports reading and writing in a plethora of
[raster](http://gdal.org/formats_list.html) and
[vector](http://gdal.org/ogr_formats.html) formats. And, while GeoTrellis
supports a few of the most popular, there's currently no plan to achieve
format parity with GDAL. If you'd like to work with an esoteric format
(which GDAL supports), you're in luck: `geotrellis.gdal` leans on
GDAL to effectively extend the range of formats with which GeoTrellis can work.  

NOTE: Using the `geotrellis.gdal` module requires a working installation of
GDAL's java bindings.

#### Example

In the following example, we will look at the code necessary to attempt
a read of an [HDF5](http://gdal.org/frmt_hdf5.html) raster band. The
result of a successful reading is an tuple of the form
`(geotrellis.raster.Tile, geotrellis.raster.RasterExtent)`.

```scala
import geotrellis.gdal._

val firstBand: (Tile, RasterExtent) =
  GdalReader.read(path = "/path/to/my/file.he5", band = 1)
```

Note that the `band` parameter specifies the band to be read and turned
into a tile rather than the number of bands expected.
